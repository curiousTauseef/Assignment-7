# Assignment 7, CodePath Alumni Professional Interview Prep Course, November 2017 - January 2018
Well, this was a real wake-up call. :-( Are people really expected to be able to complete all the requested functionality "within a time window of 60-90 minutes"? I guess I need to put in a lot of practice in banging out prototypes as quickly as possible.

Here's a walkthrough of the app, such as it is:

## Notes
To run this app, you will need to replace "your API key here" in the following line of MainActivity.java --
```
        String tmdbApiKey = "put your API key here";
```
-- with your own TMDb API key.

## Required TMDb attribution
